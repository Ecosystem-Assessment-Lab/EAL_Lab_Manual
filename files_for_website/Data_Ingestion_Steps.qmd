Below are the steps to adding new data post cruise.

### 1. Create New GitHub Branch

Click the dropdown in the top left corner of the SFER repo to view the branches. To organize branches we will name the new branch "newdata_cruiseid" (ex. newdata_WS25024). Type the name in the bar and click "create 'new branch' from main". This will create a clone of the current repository that you can work from.

### 2. Fill Blank Templates

Select the new branch from the list in the upper left hand corner. Navigate to the Blank Templates folder SFER \> DATA \> Intermediate_Data \> Blank Templates.

Our data is organized by creating multiple CSVs for the categories of Station Log (general sampling information), Nutrients, Chl a, Oxygen, and Incubations. Once these CSVs are filled out then a script is run to format the data all together into the final data format to be added to the long-term running dataset. The files with the suffix "\_blank" are emtpy CSVs with the column names of variables that need to be filled out manually during data entry.

Fill out the "\_blank" CSVs and save them in the "Intermediate_Data" folder with no suffix.

### 3. Stitch Intermediate Data Sources into Final Format (Work in Progress)

Next we will run the "Intermediate_to_Final.qmd" script to merge the intermediate datasets together and format in preparation for adding to the larger dataset, produce a QA/QC report to double check data, and add the data to the historical data (within this branch only).

::: callout-important
"Intermediate_to_Final.qmd" still needs to be tweaked once we finalize data and flagging etc.

Also I intend to make this a GitHub action so that anyone can "press a button" and can run that script.

### 4. Review QA/QC script and Merge Branches (Work in Progress)

Review the report to make sure the data are correct before adding to historical dataset. Once it has been reviewed, merge the newdata branch into the main branch. The SFER_data.csv will now have the new data added.

TO DO: - Intermedaite prodcuts should actually be the full historical dataset of that category. - Can still have them files added with cruise suffix
